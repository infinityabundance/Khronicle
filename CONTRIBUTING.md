# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Khronicle. This project optimizes for long-term
understanding and trust. Changes should preserve clarity and compatibility.

## Contribution Expectations

- Code must be readable and comment intent, not just mechanics
- Documentation updates are required when behavior or architecture changes
- Tests are expected for:
  - logic and parsing
  - rules and signals
  - interpretation layers

## Review Checklist (Self-Review)

Before submitting, confirm:

- Does this change introduce implicit behavior?
- Does it blur the line between fact and inference?
- Does it degrade explainability or auditability?
- Does it break existing data or schema expectations?
- Are docs updated where users or contributors would notice?

## Style & Philosophy

Khronicle optimizes for long-term understanding, not short-term novelty.
If a change is clever but not clear, favor the clear version.

See `GOVERNANCE.md` for decision-making principles.
