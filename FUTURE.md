# Future

This file is intentionally non-binding. It captures ideas and questions without
creating a roadmap obligation.

## Ideas Under Consideration

- Additional package manager parsers (non-Arch ecosystems)
- Richer snapshot metadata for hardware or drivers
- Better filtering and navigation for large timelines

## Ideas Explicitly Rejected

- Autonomous remediation or system policy enforcement
- Remote command execution or centralized control plane
- Opaque scoring or black-box inference

## Questions Worth Exploring

- How to preserve explainability as rule complexity grows
- How to visualize multi-host timelines without losing clarity
- What minimal metadata improves provenance without noise
